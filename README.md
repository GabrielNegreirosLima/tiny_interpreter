# Tiny Interpreter

The Tiny Interpreter found here is the first practical work developed in the field of programming languages, discipline of the fourth period of the bachelor of computer engineering of CEFET-MG.

It was done under the standard of interpreter projects (under construction) by myself, Gabriel Negreiros Lima and my classmate Ant√¥nio. We worked with NetBeans IDE.


This application was made on the academic level only as learning.
